# Secor 0.22 _(Kafka 0.10.0.1)_

This project uses Docker (and Gradle under the hood) to produce a Docker image containing an uber-jar (single jar containing all dependencies) version of Pinterest Secor (https://github.com/pinterest/secor).

Currently, this project packages Secor 0.22, using Kafka client version 0.10.0.1.

`docker-entrypoint.sh` is the entrypoint into the image, it is responsible for taking passed in ENV vars at runtime and configuring Secor accordingly. The table below shows all ENV variables you can specify to configure Secor's operation.

## Building the Image

You can build the image locally by doing:

```shell
docker build -t secor .
```

To release a new version to the ovotech Docker org, you must create a tag/release in the git repository. The name of the tag will be used as the Docker release tag.

## How to Run

If you are running from outside an AWS instance, you must specify AWS credentials:

```shell
docker run \
  -e DEBUG=true \
  -e ZOOKEEPER_QUORUM=zookeeper.quorum.consul:2181 \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_KEY \
  -e AWS_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET \
  -e SECOR_S3_BUCKET=my-kafka-backups \
  -e SECOR_GROUP=raw_logs \
  secor
```

There are many more configuration options that can be passed in via `-e NAME=value`, described in the table below.

```shell
./gradlew shadowJar
```
